In [this paper](https://teo-val.github.io/papers/ojos.pdf) (spanish) we figured out
how different features can skew the results of a machine learning algorithm. 
We used different features, such as basic statistics measures (mean, deviation...),
more advanced ones like contrast, coarseness or even the Hu moments. Finally, 
we introduce how Zernike moments help the accuracy of the model, as it figures
out shapes instead of colors.
